MathJS

Javascript Math Helper library

I started to write this library to collect functions I would use in my game development experiments in JS.

Although the name says MathJS I will collect in here all those functions and objects I happen to 
include or develop in every game small or large I coded through the years.

There are already good libraries out there for some of the functionality I wanted, but sometimes they 
are too generic and lack that simplicity you would expect for simple concepts and tasks.

My goal is to keep every element as lean as possible and add functionality only where required, and only
when I'm sure it is something I will reuse plenty of times.

So I apologize if some of the objects look incomplete. 

I hope that with feedback and more people using the lib, it will look more and more feature complete
for the needs of many. 

What we have so far
